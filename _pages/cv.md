Work experience
======
* July 2017 - present: Assistant Professor
  * Tohoku University, Japan
  * Working at the Fracture and Reliability Research Institute within the School of Engineering, in collaboration with the Institute for Materials Research at Tohoku University.
  * Awarded (PI) Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for Early Career Researchers 19K15273 (2019-2021), "Developing models for CALPHAD-type phase diagrams that directly consider the effect of structural point defects".

* March 2017 - July 2017: Postdoctoral Research Associate
  * Imperial College London, UK
  * Working with Professor Mike Finnis in a project on the theory and calculation of thermophysical properties of Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs). Developing methods to improve the use of first principles calculations of defect properties in the assessment of thermodynamic databases, combining the CALPHAD method with DFT calculations.

* October 2015 - December 2016: Graduate Teaching Assistant
  * University of California Berkeley, USA
  * Working as a calculus tutor for first year undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, spending a semester abroad in London. Students are enrolled at ACCENT College in London, where they receive calculus lectures once a week, complemented by drop in tutoring sessions.
