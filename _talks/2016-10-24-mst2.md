Zirconium carbide is an ultra-high temperature ceramic (UHTC), which is a candidate material for use in Generation IV fuel reactors due to its high hardness and melting point exceeding 3500K. For these applications, precise knowledge of the phase stability of the material as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure is required. Since the publication of the widely used carbon- zirconium phase diagram [1], there have been many experimental studies of the phase boundaries, as well as many theoretical calculations of thermodynamic properties. Using the CALPHAD approach, an updated thermodynamic description for the carbon zirconium system is produced, using all available experimental and theoretical insights. The phase diagram and thermodynamic properties are compared with experimental data and shown to be consistent.
