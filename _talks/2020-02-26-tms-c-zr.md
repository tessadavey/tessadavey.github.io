Zirconium carbide is of interest in nuclear and aerospace industries due to its extremely high melting point. Its properties are strongly affected by significant structural vacancies. Conventional CALPHAD-type phase diagram models do not directly consider such defects, and the widely-used C-Zr phase diagram [1] has been shown to be intrinsically incompatible with our physical understanding of structural point defects [2].

In this work, state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of defect-related properties [3,4] are used to inform development of specific Gibbs energy models for cases where many structural point defects are present. Incorporating such information directly into the thermodynamic database produces a more physically consistent description and may allow further predictive ability.
