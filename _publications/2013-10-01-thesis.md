Investigating gas flows through granular beds under shock conditions, using a shock tube in the Royal British Legionâ€™s Centre for Blast Injury Studies at Imperial College London, to create a propagating pressure pulse through various specifications of granular beds. The effects of a range of properties of granular beds on an incident blast wave were examined over a range of timescales, and experiments were con- ducted with shocks of different Mach numbers for comparison.
